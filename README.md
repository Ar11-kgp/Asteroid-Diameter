# Asteroid-Diameter Prediction
The objective of this project is to predict the diameter of the asteroids based on different parameters or features that will be included in the dataset. 
In this model, I have trained two different models (Random Forest and Gradient Booster Machines) and have tuned them with various hyperparameters, then compare both the models for their predictions.
